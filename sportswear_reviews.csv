909,"Let me start off by saying I could hardly wait to wash this relaxer out of my head to review it. With that being said... I LOVED IT! I initially purchased this product based on its positive reviews on Amazon but, while waiting for it to come in the mail I read its reviews on other sites and became nervous. Most reviews stated that this relaxer was more of a ""texlax"" than an actual relaxer because its so mild. Some reviews even stated that after they finished applying this product it looked as if their hair had never even been relaxed. I have extremely coarse, resistant hair and knew that a mild relaxer wouldnt phase it.

Well, the product arrived today and I was anxious yet very eager to apply it.I started at the back and worked my way up. I would also like to add that ANY relaxer that I previously used burned almost immediately after touching my head and by the time its applied to my entire head I was nearly in tears from the pain and have to wash it out before working it through my hair. Thereafter it hurts to rinse the relaxer out as well as the shampoo and conditioner. I also have sores in my head from the burns. That was not the case with this product. I was able to apply and thoroughly work it through without even the faintest detection of burning. Lastly, after rinsing the relaxer out and a deep conditioning, my hair is bone straight and appears to be in good shape.

I realize that everyone has different hair and that everyones hair will react differently but I think this is a very good product, even if it is a little pricey!",Let me start off by saying I could hardly wait to wash this relaxer out of my head to review it.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

He is EXTREMELY picky about everything and therefore I always discourage him from buying things online that he cant try on. He has narrow hips and muscular thighs so almost everything that fits in the waist is too tight on the thigh. Ive had to toss his last two pairs of khakis due to friction in the crotch region...

These are perfect all over and the material is strong enough to withstand his apparently clenched walking posture. Hes 64"" and they are a great length.

1241,"I love how these fit. They are super comfortable for yoga, running, or just lounging. I am hard to fit in yoga pants - theyre always way too long, because I have short legs and a bit of a chubby butt/thighs. Im 53"" and about 135 lbs, pants size 8-petite or 8-short. The medium was PERFECT for me in black. I loved them so much I ordered charcoal, which unfortunately is slightly too long, but wearable and still better than most other yoga pants! The fabric is stretchy and smooth, and doesnt become baggy after a couple hours like lesser quality material does. So far no pilling with the black after about 10 washes (havent washed the charcoal yet.) I also have a short waist, and I love that these pants sit right at my belly button (theyre NOT low rise) which prevents them from sliding down the hips and gapping at the back when in downward dog. My teenage daughter and my husband both think I look great in these, and with my short, curvy figure thats hard to do in yoga pants! My only small complaint is that the seam down the front can cause a bit of cameltoe, which is not uncomfortable but not an attractive look in my opinion.",I love how these fit.,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

1395,"I ordered a large size for myself because I had a pair from a year or so ago that I got and they fit me pretty well. These are capris, and Im just 50"", so they are regular pants length on me. I wore them in the Disney World full marathon yesterday, and they were warm and didnt fall at all. Im wide in the hips with thick thighs that rub constantly, and my requirement for running pants or shorts is that NO skin can touch...these do great for me. I definitely recommend these pants.

The only thing that is making me give them 4 stars instead of 5 is the color. I ordered Flashmode, after looking through every single question asked by other Amazon users and seeing the answers about the colors, even some from the manufacturer itself. After looking at the answers, I decided this one will be the most muted (the company called Watermelon the neon pink color in the answers). Turns out, the flashmode option is also neon pink. Like super bright. They didnt match my shirt at all (see the pics...). But whatever...at least they werent see through (I had on dark purple underwear and I checked like crazy to make sure you couldnt see through them).

1857,"These are ok. I have a favorite pair of Adidas pants and I wanted to see what Nike had to offer in comparison. The Adidas remain my favorite pair. The main difference is the Adidas pants material is a bit thicker and seems of higher quality. The Nike pants have a very thin material and its quite comfortable, but it seems almost too thin. The second big difference is the zippers. The Adidas pants zippers move freely and are easy to zip/unzip, both legs and pockets. The Nike zippers are smaller, which might seem better but they are hard to move! You have to use two hands to move them. One hand has to hold the pants in place, while the other hand moves the zipper. And since the pocket zippers close in the upward direction, I tend to just not zip them closed since it takes two hands and you look like an idiot trying to zip your zipper. This leads to the final complaint: the pockets are super shallow and stuff like your wallet and phone WILL fall out unless the pocket is zipped.

The Nike Tech Fleece are very comfortable and very stylish. I feel confident wearing it when I am out doing errands. I love that it has a tapered bottom which allows my Nike shoes to show. It also prevents the bottom from getting wet when it rains or it snows. Would I feel confident wearing it to a date? Probably not. I dont think I would be ready for that quite yet.

Although I love these pants, there are a few things that I dont like which prevents it from getting a higher rating. First of all, I will admit that the price is a little ridiculous for sweatpants. I am a huge Nike fan and even I find it hard to justify paying for sweatpants that are almost the same cost as a new pair of sneakers. I also dont like that it is already starting to pill in some areas. For such an expensive price, this should not be happening.

Would I recommend this pants? Yes and no. If you can stomach the price or get it on sale, these Nike sweatpants are awesome. Would I ever pay $100 for them again? Absolutely not.

2818,"Why arent ALL yoga pants made like this!?! First, the obvious thing that makes this unique is the built-in pockets. Theyre compartments really. Have you ever heard of those FlipBelts? Theyre made of stretchy material, are smooth on one side, you flip them over and theres slits cut in the fabric to make a pocket to hold your phone, keys, ID, etc.? Well, I have one of those, and it works fine, but it moves around and rides up above my pants. Sport-It finally put perfect yoga pants & these flip-type belts together to make the perfect pant!

At the top, where the wide waistband is, you flip it over and you have these perfect built-in-pockets. You can fit your phone (I have the Iphone 6, in a case) in one slot, and your ID or anything else in the other pocket. The material is super stretchy so itll stretch to accommodate whatever you put in there. I also appreciate a wide waistband because I feel like its friendlier where us women tend to be a little squishy. Pants that have a tight and narrow waistband tend to pinch and highlight even the slightest bit of fat. The wide band this has does a great job of smoothing that all out.

The material itself is so very soft, which is notable given how stretchy it actually is. I even told my husband, ""feel these, theyre so soft!"" He did, and agreed. Theyre also quite stretchy, which is good because they looked fairly small out of the bag they came in. For reference (gasp), Im 5 7"" and currently about 145 lbs. Im heavier than my usual self, so once I lose a few lbs, these will fit perfect. They fit fine, but in my opinion, were pretty tight on my behind. But then again, all yoga pants are. I often have trouble with pant legs being too short, and as you can see in the picture, I even have some slack at the ankles. I love that they are stretchy and long enough to prevent them from riding up. I love these pants - they are SUPER well made, comfortable and functional.

I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest & unbiased review. 100% of the opinions I give are my honest opinions and are NOT influenced by anything other than the functionality, price and actual use of this product.

I bought a pair at a Nike outlet store and thus could try them on. I normally buy a Medium if its long enough. But after trying them on, I took a Large and definitely couldnt have gone a size smaller. Im 61"" and 178lbs with a 33 waist.
I spoke with a sales guy there who was athletically built and he confirmed for me that he also buys a full size up in these particular compression pants.
So I strongly recommend buying one size up.
Also, others have noted that these are constricting in the groin. I agree. Youll notice the cut has a low ""drop"", meaning they have a short distance from the bottom of the crotch to the waist band. Thats what makes them feel constricted and is one more element to the fit that requires buying one size larger than normal.

Its still a nice color and I have plenty of bold red shirts that I dont mind the slightly faded tone of this shirt.

3315,"I bought these pants to wear at the end of my pregnancy and after. I was a size 4, 125 lbs before pregnancy and based off the other reviews, I sized up and went with a medium. The quality of the pants are great - solid fabric and feel very sturdy, but I cant even get them past my thighs because the shaping is so small on top. Very disappointed as these were a top rated pant on Amazon and I thought they would be very comfortable after pregnancy and for outside workouts. Im not sure what I will do as the return shipping is almost 1/2 the cost of the pants. Three stars for the quality of the pants.
Update 1/26/15
I wanted to update my review as I was contacted by the company after writing it. They sent me a new pair of pants, in a large, and didnt ask for the other size back. I was blown away. The large fits MUCH better and I love them. I wear them after delivering a child in December and at 7 weeks post, I am about 140lbs and 54. I upped my rating to 5 stars because of the customer service. I now have a pair of pants that I can fit into and I am comfortable wearing in public - a BIG thing after having a baby.

3598,"Bought these shorts for my teenage son as he needed them for field day at school. Overall my son likes the shorts. That being said there are two flaws. 1) they run big. For him to wear that he has to tie the drawstring very tight to keep them up on his waist. 2) My son needed a white pair as he was on a team that required white shorts and white t shirt. The white is see thru especially in the direct sunlight. My son didnt notice it when he got ready for school. It wasnt actually until a friend of his pointed out that his red and black checkerboard boxer shorts were showing. My sons first thought that his shorts were sliding down his waist, which in actuality they were and he had to stop and re tie his drawstring tightly again. It was then that he noticed when he looked down how visible his underwear was. He was quite embarrassed knowing that everyone would be able to see his underwear and the fact that he was wearing red and black checkerboard boxer shorts with white shorts, made it only worse.

3739,"Upgraded to 5-stars. Very comfortable and good sizing (Some have complained of it being too large but for some of us, still trying to cling on to medium status in our mid-30s, its a perfect fit). I ordered 3 of these, 2 x Navy and 1 x Black... Strangely the navy ones were both a touch larger than the black. I think the black is probably a more correct fit for a medium size.

However, if ordering Navy, do note that the real t-shirts are much, much darker than the product image suggests. Which suits me fine, I like a rich, deep blue colour better.

Ive also noticed some people questioning whether their deliveries were counterfeit or not. I can tell you that the t-shirts I received were absolutely legit. They are made of a thin material but I have other Nike Dri-fit ts from the NFL store and they are the same... its kind of the idea of the dri-fit material!

Very nice quality and they do what theyre supposed to.

Having used these for the last 3 weeks I upgraded the review to 5-stars. Superb fit, high quality, nice and cool for training or comfortable for lounging. The black version seems to have stretched out a little and feels a good fit now, just like the navy. Also, compared to my Dri-fit Broncos t shirt, I get minimal static off these (living in Colorado, the dry weather increases this to a nightmarish level for synthetic materials.

Since we live in Virginia, its pretty darn cold this time of year, and I needed something to protect my core. For Christmas, my husband got me this top (I have the gray one-great neutral), and I wasnt sure if I would like the neckline.

Well, I was wrong! I went out jogging the other day-light snow, so that tells you just how cold it was outside-and pulled this top on. I wore this under a jacket I have from Eddie Bauer that is specifically made for layering on cold days. My core was fine, even warm I daresay - I probably didnt need the jacket afterall.

It is a bit longer than many shirts like this, so it easily covers your waist and hips, which I like. It is fitted, but not oppressively tight, and the lining is soft and wicks moisture away from you so you dont feel as if you are running in a damp shirt.

It isnt cheap, but at $50 I think this shirt is well worth the money and I will be buying this shirt in other colors.",I LOVE this top ,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

The high waist goes up to my belly button and the ankles are right where they are supposed to be. Im 56, 165 pounds.

Its a fabulous fragrance although the smell did not particularly remind me of Eucalyptus or anything else - not sure what, but its divine. I did not immediately love the fragrance but did notice that the scent tends to change and deepen after several minutes of wear. Long lasting, I could still smell it on my hands after washing my hands. The lotion has a thicker viscosity, more like cream than lotion - not at all watery, its nice and creamy and thick. I would love to have the entire line. I think Thymes used to make a shampoo and conditioner but have not been able to find it. If you like spa scents - this is the one!

The package comes with tongue depressors (application sticks), activator and the relaxer creme. With the being said, I would recommend to purchase a good neutralizing shampoo, gloves and for those who want extra assurance - mix 1 part apple cider vinegar with 3 parts water for an after shampoo rinse. The apple cider vinegar also works as a neutralizer - dont worry you wont smell like a salad.

The result I achieved with the texlax was great. It left my hair silky, shiny but still with a good amount of texture. This is the best texlax I have achieved with a relaxer and I will continue using the Mizani Butter Blend. Im on week 10 since I applied my texlax and my hair is still VERY manageable - which is great for my hair health. Even my new growth is coming in nicely.

The sweatshirt fits him nicely, it is just a bit loose, which is the fit he prefers.

The fabric is a smooth manmade material that is lightweight, yet retains warmth effectively.
This is a standard cut sweatshirt, though a bit more form-fitting than some.
It has a roomy kangaroo pocket and a well-fitted hood. I think the fitted hoods look so much nicer, on or off, than the more cheaply made hoods.
Perhaps its best feature though, is the full lining: a very soft cozy fleece.

A logo is displayed discreetly at the back of the neck and on the breast of the sweatshirt.
These are not showy at all, so I dont mind having them there.

I really like the classic appearance of this garment, as does my husband. He appreciates the soft fleece lining as well.","I got this sweatshirt in an extra large for my husband, who is 511  and weighs about 185 pounds.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

The charcoal grey is a great color that will go with anything and this can be worn with sweats, joggers, jeans or shorts.

The Good:
The Heathers are nice and thick. Not compression, but not see through. Theyre listed as 87% Nylon 13% Spandex. They do show sweat rather easily so be aware if youre doing something super sweaty like Cycle.

The Bad:
Black...the fit was horrible, the cut was off and theyre the material that attracts lint faster than you can say ""but I just lint brushed them"".

The Meh:
I just received the Magenta space dye (90% Polyester 10% Spandex) while the waist band is nice and thick, the capris are thinner and the calf area runs much tighter with the hips and thighs running too large. These WILL show undies if you bend over (tested with black solid ones). Theyre a much more vibrant and vivid color in person and theyre really pretty, but the feel of these is a much cheaper fabric quality.Theyre too stretchy almost, and are very thin. Ill probably keep them though since theyre loud and dont turn white when doing squats (my pet peeve are leggings backed with white that change colors when you move in any way).

6874,"**Quick Edit**Have used the sandals while photographing a Mud Run and got them completely caked in squishy mud. After a couple hand washings theyre good as new. Also used a couple times on a beach. Sandals work great unless you start submerging them/walk on slushy sand. They will still have traction with your feet, but the suction from the sand will make it a bit hard to take steps.**End Edit**

Havent wrote a review on Amazon in ages. Recent experience with the Celso Ultra though has prompted me to share my thoughts on the upgrade to an already great flip flop.

The Celso thong sandals have been a standard choice for many who wanted a waterproof flip flop with a snug fit for years. The first version 4-5 years ago (Celso Thong) was very flat, had a comfortable rubber cushion pad, and a soft neoprene strap. The second version 2-3 years ago (Celso Plus Thong) had a reinforced strap as well as a slightly better rubber cushion and sole.

Both the previous models were great for about a year, and were easily disposable/recyclable after that due to their cheap cost and construction. Both models also were extremely comfortable and snug, and one could even jog for short distances in them without much issue. However, despite being waterproof, both models would make annoying ""squish"" sounds when wet, the foot would slip on the rubber pad (but the sole of the flip flop stayed put), and on a certain kind of marble surface the sole would completely give way and slide around.

The Ultra Celso addresses these issues well, while still staying within the cheap ~$25 price range.
-Just as comfortable as the previous models, with a slightly firmer material for the pad
-Ribbed pattern on pad sheds water well and maintains positive traction. No more ""squish"" with every step either.
-Sole is much stiffer, almost like a regular shoe. Is also tapered in the front and back to help prevent scraping.
-Slightly thinner neoprene band, also a bit more reinforced
-More arch support in the pad

There is, however, just a few issues with the Ultra Celso to note:
-Band fit is slightly different than previous Celsos. Still snug, but goes back a bit further, may be uncomfortable for some at first.
-Pad size is slightly smaller than previous Celsos. If you have a half size (like 12.5, 13.5, etc.), consider sizing up.

For care, and to prevent sticky foot-goo buildup on the pad, rinse weekly in the shower by hand (with a mild soap if you have especially dirty feet). Air dry for a few hours and youre good to go. To ""break in"" the flip flops, try to sit and stand with your heel and toes properly centered on the pad for the first week as you walk around and lounge with them. This will help form the proper size of the depression in your pad for the foot to rest in for maximum support and comfort.

Previous models lasted a good year of wear and tear before it was time for another pair. Will update this review if these last at least as long as the other Celsos.",  Quick Edit  Have used the sandals while photographing a Mud Run and got them completely caked in squishy mud.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

7208,"I bought these shirts in 2014 and my initial response to these shirts was they were fantastic. All the seams l lie flat inside and out. Fit was good felt great on so long as I only wore them short term. So for fit and quality of manufacture they would get 5 stars, but this is 2016 and I believe there are some other considerations and technologies that should be added to this type of shirt. I used these shirts as I worked maintenance for a condo and later as a pest control technician.

Having anti-odor/Anti-microbial technology made into the shirt didnt seem that important when I bought these items. However, it has to be if you need to wear a shirt made with this type of fabric longer than a few hours. When I wore these shirts under my short sleeve work shirt they became foul smelling on long hot days. I thought it might be me forgetting deodorant or something, I even carried a spare stick in my truck. After I switched to another brand with anti-odor/Anti-microbial properties I didnt have the odor issues I had with the Nike Dry Fit. So this consideration is rated by me a critical fail.

Additionally these are not advertised as having any sun protection capability, another component I need here in NW Florida. I now wear this type of shirt to play tennis to try to stay cool in the summer and get some protection from the sun to make my dermatologist happy. I want to avoid sunscreen so it doesnt mess up my grip on the racquet. After wearing these shirts for nearly a year my dermatologist treated and area in the middle of my back. Hence my renewed interest in UPF shirts. Again this area is rated by me as a critical fail.

Bottom Line: Just dont, I have to replace these Nike Dry Fit shirts to get the anti-odor/Anti-microbial and UPF 50 capabilities available in other shirts so I wasted my money on Nike.

Ive probably thrown away at least $500 worth of specialized running and workout bras for large chested women(Moving Comfort, I dont think so). They were ugly, the straps were excruciating, they had modeled cups that were uncomfortable or an underwire. Ive had my arms go numb while trying to wear something specifically designed for large sizes and high impact. I finally switched back to what I wore in high school, Nikes basic sports bra. I get it in a small to keep the girls strapped in. It works beautifully. No uncomfortable straps, no irritating underwire or specially molded cups. No to mention with the range of patterns available, you can get some pretty cute styles. You can even coordinate them with your shorts, if you are so inclined to go shirtless.

Update:

After being washed and dried multiple times, the Russell Athletic Mens Essential Short Sleeve Tee has held up admirably and shows absolutely no signs of wear.

But after reading The Art of Non-Conformity and following Chris adventure blogs, Im convinced not only CAN it be done, but it MUST be done. Ive always been a non-conformist who has unfortunately conformed for the majority of my life. But the artist and thinker in me rebels and wants something completely different. Chris inspires you to put your dreams into actions. And I have! 9 months ago I didnt have a website, a product to sell or dreams of really doing what I want. I especially didnt give much thought about how I could help others through art. But Chris shows you how it can be done even if its scary. Now I find myself excited about my work each day and positively affecting the lives of others somewhere in the world. In our culture of over active self-indulgence, this ""manifesto"" loudly shouts ""Freedom!"" and shows you how to get it. Thanks Chris for putting yourself out there and not being afraid to tell the truth. We all need to start re-thinking our life: what we want out of it, how we want to spend our precious time, and what kind of legacy we want to leave behind. Im inspired!

My usual inseam length to top of my shoe is approx 30.5 inches. I ordered 3 pairs of this pant in 3 different colors, Heather Gray, Light Heather Gray, and Navy. All 3 were different lengths, and the heather gray and light heather gray were approx. 1-1.5 inches bigger from the hip/seat area and down the leg, making the pant appear even wider in the legs. The navy color was of a slightly smaller cut, (better for me, I wanted loose leg, but not overly blousey) and shorter in length. The Navy pant inseam length was 31inches, lgt heather gray was 32.5 inches, and the heather gray was 33.5 inches in inseam length respectively. As the navy pair was the only pair that fit me best and would not require me to have them shortened, I returned the other two pairs. The refund was credited to my amazon prime card quickly. Im apprehensive about ordering the black pair as Im not sure how the cut or length will be in comparison to the navy pair I kept.

This particular Nike Dri-Fit Training shirt has an MSRP of $22 (see picture of the tag from the green shirt for $22 and I paid $24 for it) and most of them listed here are going for $22-$30. That is ridiculous. You can go to Dicks Sporting Goods website and get them for $16.50. I ordered two of these shirts in red and green size XL for $23 and $24 respectively. The only reason I ordered these is because I thought they were the Dri-Fit Ts that normally retail for ~$35 and I thought I was getting a good deal. I have two of the $35 dri-fit t-shirts already, which fit really nice (not tight, I hate tight shirts, but not loose). These cheaper dri-fit t-shirts fit much larger than the $35 ones (see picture red $22 MSRP from amazon on left and navy $35 MSRP from Dicks on right, both XL). I am 63"", 230 lbs and the XL feels like I am wearing a dress.

I will be returning these shirts. I paid too much for what they actually are, and on top of that the fit is a little on the large size. There is no problem with the shirts quality wise, besides the larger fit. But if you do want one of these, do yourself a favor and dont order from here.

The super-reflective design is great for safer evening runs, and overall the jacket is really comfortable. My only complaint is the very athletic cut of this item, if I get the right fit through my chest, then the sleeves are extra-long--but this is easily addressed.

9048,"I got the armory slate/volt yellow color way. Subtle with a little bit of color.
Size was a large and I usually wear a size 31 pants if I want it to fit comfortably. Actual measurement is probably closer to a 30. Most of time Im a small or medium. Theres no way I could comfortably wear a medium and after some test fitting, decided a large was best fit to maintain some of the compression effect while not choking my waist and hips. The product definitely stretches the tightest across the hips and the outside of your legs as if it trying to squeeze your legs closed all the time. Theres little to no compression effect on the inside of your thighs and especially not at the top / crotchular area.
Speaking of the crotchular area, the seam runs straight up the middle. The seam is somewhat pronounced but not enough to annoy you all the time. The competitor does this area better.
The material is thin and breathes well. When it warms up they would be a good wear for outdoor soccer in the dredging heat.

9695,"Buying clothes off Amazon can be so hard if you dont have a review and pictures so Ill try to be as helpful as possible.

First off I was really surprised at how soft the material was. It seemed like it was pretty good quality. There is a few loose threads that you dont usually see on say Lululemon clothing but it was very easy to just snip those off.

The material is definitely thicker (not see-through or thin) and has a nice fit to it. I once ordered a pair of yoga pants off the Wish app and it was horrible. So when I saw that it looked like these were originally from overseas I was a bit leery. But I am totally pleased!

Obviously with the mash you always wonder how long it will hold up. My Lululemons have held up wonderfully but these dont seem quite as hardcore quality. I think it seems like good quality just it will be interesting to see how many washes or--if the mesh snags.

Its comes up right below your belly button so its a higher waste which I really like. Its plenty tight on my waist which I also love as it holds in any unnecessary bulges of fat LOL.

I was a tiny bit worried that the mesh actually went up too far on the backside making it a little immodest.(yeah I know, Im a mom of 4 I have a teenager so I try to set an okay example) so I showed my husband and he said they seemed just fine. But I will warn you that the mesh goes up probably an inch below wear your underwear line would be! But its a very small mesh area thats up that far.

Regarding what size to where I am about 19% body fat 5 foot 6 + 140 pounds. In Lululemon Im a size 4-6. I decided to go with the medium even though they said that was more like a 4. I probably could have done a large but I do like the way these fit so Im not going to return them for a larger size I think they are just fine. My husband said that they look tight but thats only because he was staring at them and doesnt realize that is how all of my yoga pants fit (:

Overall, I am pleasantly surprised. They are slenderizing pretty good quality and the mesh is very cute. I love unique workout pants.

9951,"Here is what differentiates these t-shirts from most others in terms of fit:
If you lay nike or UA t-shirts flat, the sleeves angle down. This fits well and looks good during normal wear when your arms are down by your side. But for athletic activities where you raise your arms, the entire t-shirt will ride up. If you lay out the Russell t-shirts, the sleeves are closer to 90 degrees with the body, making more of a ""T"". So during normal wear, the material will be a little bunched up under the arms, and maybe less comfortable. But during athletic activities where you raise your arms, these become more comfortable and fit better. So basically, although Nike and UA are supposed to be more hard-core athletic wear, for basic all cotton shirts, these are more comfortable for athletic activities, while the others are more comfortable as a daily wear.

As far as durability, I have a bunch of these shirts (i have the dark colored all-cotton shirts) that I wear for basketball and working out that are now over 2 years old. That is over 100 wash cycles. The color is fading a bit, but they are as strong and durable as the day I bought them. They would be my preferred t-shirts at twice the price, but for their actual price, they are a steal.","Here is what differentiates these t shirts from most others in terms of fit  If you lay nike or UA t shirts flat, the sleeves angle down.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
